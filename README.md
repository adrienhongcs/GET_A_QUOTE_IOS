# GET A QUOTE! (IOS App)
This project is the IOS version of the web application [GET A QUOTE](https://github.com/adrienhongcs/GET_A_QUOTE). Since the IOS app consumes the same REST api service as the web app, they both interact with the same data and display the same content (look [here](https://github.com/adrienhongcs/GET_A_QUOTE) to better understand how the server is set up).

**This project uses Swift and SwiftUI to build a reactive User Interface**
